This is a simple game I made. If you want to play the game clone the github repository. Make sure you have python 3 along with the pygame package installed on your device to play the game

Some instructions while playing the game:
This game does not involve the use of a mouse so dont attempt to use it. In certain cases, clicking in or outside the game window may cause the game to crash. Please do not open any other window while playing the game
In any menu, yellowed text represented the current text selected. Use arrow keys or WASD to navigate menus (again do not try to use mouse)
Press enter to perform the action of the selected. Note that if your keyboard has multiple enter keys, only one of them will work. If none of the enter keys on your keyboard work, please contact me and I will try to fix it
Note that this is a game written by an amateur, so bugs might obviously arise. Please report any bugs or difficulties to me and I will try to solve them

You are free to modify the source code as you wish on your own device. You may spin off or improve this game as you wish
